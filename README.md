# Dpkg::Deb

A ruby wrapper for dpbk-deb that allows reading of control information from .deb packages

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'dpkg-deb'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dpkg-deb

This gem requires dpkg-deb in the path and thus works only on debian-based systems.
